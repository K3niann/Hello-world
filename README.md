# Hello-world
Another repository

Hello class, my name is Keniann or Kenny for short, and I'm addicted to cheesecake!
I'm from Venezuela and I have been living in the US for 8 years.
I'm currently enrolled in the software development program (after changing my major 3 times).
I started with Business Administration but I had already gone to school for something similar in Venezuela.
This time, I wanted to do something different and fun.
Arts were always interesting to me but I could not find exactly where I fit.
After taking CTI 110, I realized that codes were challenging and fun at the same time, so I changed my major!
Other than that, I'm a dog lover! I have a chihuahua (Ginger) and a poodle (Sugar).
I like watching comedy movies, going out to eat, shopping, skating, traveling, decorating my apartment, and now coding lol.
The end.
